    // The Alphabet
    gpt: "Terrible. Black people be looking Australian as hell, I HAVE NEVER SEEN A WORSE PORTRAYAL OF ADOLESCENCE!, overappted nonsense that tries desperately to hide the fact that NO-ONE involved knew what they were doing, and NO-ONE has. A CLUE what it's supposed to mean and how they were gonna get where they were trying to get. Complete waste of my fucking time.",

    // Sinister
    gpt: "This is the only film from this director that is worth a damn, not amazing, but utterly solid for what it is. We get Sinister which is very creative, and sinister (lol) while being able to be genuinely spooky and engaging. That being said, the scares do wear off in multiple re watches, and as the only thing holding this film up is the unique presentation, it’s a watch once type film and then move on with your life.",

      "Things I liked: Cool satanic backstory stuff, Ridiculously stupid main character. Things I didn't like: Children weren't scary, Videotapes get repetitive. It was a fun horror movie but I don't think it packed enough punch for me personally.",

      "I love when the capitalist machine tries to make a statement on sociological affairs and fails miserably. The car chase scene made me cringe so intensely with its pristine product placement that really states my biggest problem with the film; its saying NOTHING!!! It’s moments of obnoxious meta commentary and overtly explicit statements on feminism don't contribute jack shit even when removing the obvious commercialism. In many ways I feel bad since the film was doomed to be shallow.",

    // The Piano Teacher
    gpt: "One of the most painful movies about intimacy ever made that isn’t retreated into woke aesthetics. Such a strange film that is equal parts infuriating and disgusting as it is interesting and kinda relatable. Check out the bodies of top posts on Letterboxd and try to unravil behind the curtain why female viewers rate a film like this soo incredibly higher than men.",
    gavin:
      "Though the meaning is pretty diversified to fans of the film, to me this is a film about repression and self-loathing leading to fetishizing your own insecurities, and it portrays this through the absolute masterclass performance from Huppert. Definitely not one for the family. PS: I don't know who leaked this movie to the public but all the tiktok white girls getting into this movie for all the wrong reasons pains me to see. Please stay away from Haneke you freaks!",

      "This was my first Tarantino film and one I thoroughly enjoyed, I can see why people enjoy his style so much now. His long, drawn-out yet witty and delightful dialogue never feels like it panders, every small joke or little remark hints at the character's emotion without directly exposing it to us as the audience.",
